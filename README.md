## User Experience
This website is for people who would like to take small steps in their world to make a change in the bigger picture. In order to achieve
 this goal, the organisation creates projects and events that the users can attend.
 There is a Newsletter subscription form to recieve more details about projects and the organisation events.

* User can subscribe to the news letter or following social media links (still in progress) to get information.

  The hamburger menu button will be improved by using Java Script language and the subscription button will be fixed.
